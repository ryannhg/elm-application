# ryannhg/application
> a way to build single page applications with Elm.

## Overview

Making single page applications in Elm is pretty great! You can create routes and match them up with different pages.

This project, `ryannhg/application` is an attempt to preserve the flexibility and simplicity of the Elm architecture, while rearranging things so you can more directly see the relationship between your routes and pages.

## Local Development

Right now, I'm still exploring the API in the `examples` folder. This is how I'm running things:

1. __`cd examples`__

1. __`npm install`__

1. __`npm run dev`__
